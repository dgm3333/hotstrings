HotString library for AutoIt3
==========

HotStrings are similar to AutoIts HotKey function but they trigger on a string of characters, instead of a key or key combination. This has been built because of popular requested from the community.

Instructions for use: Download the HotString.au3 (that is attached in this post) and put it in the same directory as your script. Then try out the code example below, or use the library in your own application.
